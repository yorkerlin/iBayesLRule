* To-do List:
  * To add [slides](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) of the talk.
  * To add a Python [implementatoin](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) of the implicit reparameterization gradient for the inverse Gaussian distribution (See Appendix H of the paper)
  * To add a Matlab [implementation](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) for the examples using full Gaussian approximation (See Appendix E of the paper)
  * To add a Matlab [implementation](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) for the examples using MoG approximation (See Appendix J of the paper)
  * To add a Matlab [implementation](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) for the example using Gamma approximation (See Appendix F of the paper)
  * To add a Python [implementation](https://github.com/yorkerlin/iBayesLRule/) for the Adam-like update using factorized/diagonal Gaussian approximation (See Appendix E.3 of the paper)
